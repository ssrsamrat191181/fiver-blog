        <p>Fiverr’s talented new Pro seller offers various Music & Audio services on Fiverr,<br> and he has some great advice to offer new sellers on the platform.</p>

        <p><b>What services do you offer on Fiverr Pro?</b></p>
        <p>I’m offering mixing and mastering, remixing and ghost <br> producing, vocal tuning/mixing, club/festival intro composing and podcast/dialogue audio mixing.</p>
        <p><strong>How would you describe your work style and inspiration?</strong></p>
        <p>I constantly optimize my workstyle. For me, this process is never ending,<br> whether it means updating templates for a quicker, more efficient workflow,<br> researching new software or improved techniques, and reading about <br> business, communication, and the many aspects of the service industry. As <br> for inspiration, I look to mentors and teachers who are top of their game, and <br> learn from them as often as I can.</p>
        <p><b>What tips do you have for other sellers, offering services in your category?</b></p>
        <p>My best advice would be to see everything you do as an experience, from the <br> moment that first message arrives in your inbox, right up until the delivery is <br> accepted, and beyond if a client comes back with a question. What <br> experience are you giving your client, are you going above and beyond, and <br> basically, are you treating them the way you would want to be treated? And <br> specifically, within the music/audio categories, never stop learning. Although <br> you may be a Pro seller, as technological changes are now more rapid than <br> ever, keeping up to date with the latest software and techniques will help <br> keep you ahead of the pack.</p>
        <p><b>Based on your experience, what are some advantages of using Fiverr Pro?</b></p>
        <p>Joining Fiverr Pro was always a goal of mine from the moment I signed up, so <br> I’ve paid interest in many Fiverr Pro sellers, and always keep an eye on their <br> gigs and services. I’ve also read many Fiverr Pro buyer reviews to understand <br> the Pro experience from the buyers point of view. The biggest advantage I’m <br> seeing is gaining access to Fiverr clients that have bigger projects to work on, <br> and bigger budgets. </p>
